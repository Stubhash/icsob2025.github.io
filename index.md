<b style="text-align: center;">Conference Theme: Software Business in Digital Societies </b>

In an era where software permeates all aspects of society, software businesses play a critical role in driving economic progress and shaping individual and collective well-being. This transformation presents new challenges for both incumbent organizations, which are increasingly evolving into software-driven enterprises, and for established and emerging software ventures. Key issues include digital sustainability, digital infrastructure, tech regulation, and the impact of emerging technologies.
This conference aims to bring together researchers from information systems, innovation management, and software engineering, alongside industry practitioners, to explore the evolving role of software businesses in digital societies.
